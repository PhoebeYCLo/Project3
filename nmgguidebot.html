				<div class="project-context">
					<h4 class="title nmgtitle">CONTEXT</h4>
					<p>This is a user research project within a design research course where the focus was learning ethnographic research methods. We had the opportunity to work with the New Media Gallery, to research their work environment and find out an issue that we can solve through design.</p>
				</div>
					
				<hr>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h4 class="title nmgtitle">NMG</h4>
					<p>New Media Gallery (NMG) is a New Westminster civic gallery that focuses on New Media Art. The gallery curates exhibitions, performances, workshops and STEAM education programs. The gallery aims to reach out to people that art is more than what people know of what art is. The gallery wants people’s perspective to change after visiting. Educating that art can also be shown in technology. That STEM should add Arts to become STEAM.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="body-content">
					<h4 class="title nmgtitle">RESEARCH</h4>
					<p>We gather insights through interviews, ethnographic, observations, champion meetings, visitors from surveys and participatory workshops.</p>

					<h5 class="subtitle">Ethnography</h5>
					<p>From our initial observations many of the visitors knew about the gallery from someone they know. We observed that there were a majority of the visitors from Vancouver which comes from the Gallery’s mandate to draw in more visitors from metro Vancouver. Also, during our visit to the performance of last exhibition GYRE and the opening of the current Reclaim exhibition, we saw <strong>a low diversity in ethnicity. There were more Caucasians. However, during the exhibition, it was evenly diverse with East Asians.</strong></p>

					<p>Based on the takeaways, we make a design focus which is create a connection and an engagement for the visitors who are interacting with New Media Gallery for their ﬁrst time. However, the initial design focus is too vague. Therefore, we had taken time to really push to narrow down the focus. Our refined design focus is: <strong>Implementing an engagement that connects ESL visitors in order to improve their experience during the exhibition.</strong></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">Participatory Workshop</h5>
					<p>There are two goals of the workshop. The ﬁrst one is that we still felt the design focus was not in the right spot, and we wanted this workshop to really tune the focus more. The second goal is that we have a concept that has potential, but we are stuck on what the other concept is. Which could be correlating to our uncertainty with the current design focus. <strong>Therefore the workshop activities will need to help us our design focus more to connect with another concept idea.</strong></p>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">Workshop with ESL Participants</h5>
					<p>We total held two participatory workshops. We did our ﬁrst run with ESL Participants, who all have been the New Media Gallery. When we held the workshop for the ESL participants, we had the Collage at the end to help express their solutions in a more constraint, however it did the opposite, and did not constraint the ideas of the solutions. Some issues we also had were the participants were confusion of the instructions of the activities and time for the activities in an hour and half was very tight.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">Refining for second round</h5>
					<p>We realized that we will take control of the activities time frame, as some activities were more beneﬁcial in providing insights than others. As well, reorganized our instructions to make it more clear.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">Workshop with Curator</h5>
					<p>We ﬁrst started the workshop with explanation of the design focus and questions related to the design focus to the curators so that they were able to understand the goals of the workshop. Based on the answer we get back from the questions, we knew that the percentage of ESL visitor has been grown a lot during the Gyre exhibition. The curator feels happy with the increase of E SL visitors, they wanted everyone come to the gallery. However, they said they have some difficulties with international visitors such as the language barrier, but its not a large issue, if they are interested in art.</p>
					<p>After the workshop, we discussing to our champion of her thoughts of opportunities we could tackle that could beneﬁt ESL visitors. We came to a conclusion of the opportunity we wanted to narrow down on which was <strong>“How might we encourage people to share their experience and example their curiosity to come to the gallery for the exhibition or workshops?”</strong>.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">After the Workshop</h5>
					<p>We collected all the artifacts and went to an open space to debrief. We needed to debrief on the workshop and what our design focus was actually targeting, as it wasn’t mainly about the language barrier. We needed to narrow down the who is affecting by the problem and why is it a problem for them. And <strong>we narrowed it down to ESL Chinese Visitors.</strong> We selected Chinese visitors because this is <strong>a large population in the greater metro area and our client wants to expand their visitor base.</strong> Which leads us to our finalized design focus: <strong>Improve the method of educating about new media art to the Chinese ESL visitors, which creates a stronger connection between Chinese ESL visitors and New Media Gallery.</strong></p>

					<h4 class="title">IDEA</h4>
					<div class="img-container">
						<img class="projectimage" src="img/guitebotimg.jpg" alt="NMG GuidBot">
					</div>
					<p>Our concept we came up with is NMG GuideBot. It is a conversational application that is implemented as a subscription on WeChat in traditional chinese characters. This application has a conversation with the visitors outside and inside the gallery. Creating a similar personalized walkthrough they would get, if the visitors went in the exhibition with the curator.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="body-content">
					<h5 class="subtitle">Providing values & positive impacts</h5>

					<ul class="unorderlist">
						<li class="listitem">Increase public engagement</li>
						<li class="listitem">Educate about new media art</li>
						<li class="listitem">Strengthen the connection with New Media Gallery</li>
						<li class="listitem">Supports their marketing by word of mouth</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Part of the gallery’s values they want to increase public engagement. The guidebot helps as another tool for the chinese community that brings awareness towards the events and programs that the gallery holds. </p>

					<p>The guidebot can be used as a gateway to public sharing and learning of new media art. With the awareness of the events and programs, as well can include features such as linking new media art articles on WeChat.</p>

					<p>The guidebot strengthens the connection between the ESL visitors with new media gallery, as they get familiar with what the gallery can provide.</p>

					<p>The guidebot supports the word of mouth marketing and extends it towards the chinese community. The NMG Guidebot will be in Traditional chinese characters so that both madarian and cantonese can understood. </p>
